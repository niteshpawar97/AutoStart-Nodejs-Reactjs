## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AutoStart-Nodejs-Reactjs.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd AutoStart-Nodejs-Reactjs
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start both the frontend and backend servers, run the batch file `start-frontend-backend.bat`:

```bash
./start-frontend-backend.bat
```

This will start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.

## Scripts

- `start-backend`: Starts the backend server.
- `start-frontend`: Starts the frontend server.
- `start`: Uses `concurrently` to start both frontend and backend servers.
- `start-dev-backend`: Starts the backend server with `nodemon` for development.
- `dev`: Uses `concurrently` to start both frontend and backend servers in development mode.

To run any of these scripts, use `npm run <script-name>` in your terminal. For example:

```bash
npm run start-backend
```
